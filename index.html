    <h1>Contenta</h1>
    <p>We aim to design a mobile application that detects potentially harmful substances (such as aspartame, monosodium
        glutamate or E621) in the packaged food products by scanning the ingredients section with their mobile phone’s
        camera. Users will have a chance to personalize their experience if they enter their information about their
        allergies, height, and weight. Thus, our application will be able to identify which substances in the product
        content are allergens and what type of complications they may cause to the user. We are also considering using
        appropriate language processing algorithms to prevent faults (lack or misinterpretation of letters) during
        scanning process due to wrinkles and folds on the packages. Although we initially planning to develop our
        application in Turkish and/or English, we intent to provide this service for many popular languages with a
        simple translation API.</p>
